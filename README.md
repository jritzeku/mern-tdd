-In this simple Goalify application, we demonstrate testing on client side and server side. I'm fairly new to testing so Im sure there will be many room for improvement. However, it's a start and there is surprisingly little resource online for complete/thorough testing tutorials for React and Node js. 


    ->For client side testing, I mainly referred to Basar Buyukkahraman's 
    React testing coures on udemy( https://www.udemy.com/course/). I feel that
    his course had the most coverage for various cases. The user related code is almost identical however I added additional features like ability to 
    add goals, view goals, edit goals, delete goals  and testing for those. 

    
    ->For server side testing, I mainly referred to these tutorials:
    https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-test-in-express-and-mongoose-apps/

-Test results are save in folder 'TEST_RESULTS' at root folder via screenshots.
